# Pokered Save Editor

This is aimed to be a complete Pokemon Red and Blue save editor, as in, all
bytes and areas of the save file would be editable. It's designed to be very
simple to jump-in and use right away intuitively with a well-designed interface.

This project is deep in development however it's turning promising results. Here's a gif and some images of the new keyboard system that nearly a hundred hours went into:

This project was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
